Zstandard is a modern successor to zlib, providing better compression faster. Zstd-rs is *in developement*; it aims to provide excellent performance while introducing memory safety.

The project will provide a dynamic library that is a drop-in replacement for C/C++ counterparts, but has compiled memory-safe Rust code inside. For the high level goals, see our [Data compression initiative](/initiatives/data-compression/). 

### About

Development of zstd-rs began in July 2025, with the first release of the decoder planned for February 2026.
