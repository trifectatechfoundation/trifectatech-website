The goal of allowd is to provide memory-safe policy rules using D-Bus.

Allowd is part of our [Privilege Boundary initiative](/initiatives/privilege-boundary/).

### About

We will prototype an alternative approach to the current Polkit daemon, utilizing the existing external D-Bus interfaces, but improving the internal design. We also aim to demonstrate to the Freedesktop community, especially the systemd team, that Rust is well-suited for these core desktop applications, producing small and efficient binaries with limited dependencies.

### Roadmap

- 2026 Q2: Start of development

The allowd project is supported by [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/allowd/)
