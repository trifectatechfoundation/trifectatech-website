Reliable, securely synchronized time is a building block for the Internet and other critical infrastructure.

[Project Pendulum](https://github.com/pendulum-project) is the home for our time synchronization projects. It provides modern implementations of the Network Time Protocol and Precision Time Protocol and creates open services that boost secure time synchronization.

### What We've Done

Our Network Time Protocol implementation, ntpd-rs, is stable. It is packaged for, for example, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu and [deployed at Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2024/06/24/ntpd-rs-deployment).

### Roadmap

See the [ntpd-rs](/projects/ntpd-rs), [Statime](/projects/statime) and [NTS Pool](/projects/nts-pool) project pages.
